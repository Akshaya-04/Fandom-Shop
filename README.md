# Fandom-Shop
Online Fandom Shopping is a lifestyle e-commerce web application, which retails various Fandom products. This project allows viewing various products available, enables registered users to purchase desired products instantly using various payments options. This project provides an easy access to Administrators and Managers to edit the number of items and to add new items. In order to develop a simple shopping application, I have used Java and MySQL to build this project. This is a project with the objective to develop a basic application where a consumer is provided with a shopping cart application and also to know about the technologies used to develop such an application.
