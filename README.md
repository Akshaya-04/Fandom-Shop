# Fandom-Shop
Online Fandom Shopping is a lifestyle e-commerce web application, which retails various Fandom products. This project allows viewing various products available, enables registered users to purchase desired products instantly using various payments options. This project provides an easy access to Administrators and Managers to edit the number of items and to add new items. In order to develop a simple shopping application, I have used Java and MySQL to build this project. This is a project with the objective to develop a basic application where a consumer is provided with a shopping cart application and also to know about the technologies used to develop such an application. 

REQUIREMNTS: This section provides requirement overview of the system.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:  Various functional modules that will be implemented by the system will be-
Customers:
  •	Registration: If the customer wants to buy the product then he/she must be registered, unregistered user cannot go to the shopping cart. Customers can securely register on the application and manage their profile.
  
  •	Login: Customer logins to the system by entering valid user id and password for the shopping.
  
  •	Browsing through the store to see the items that are there in categories of products(books/movies).
  
  •	Changes to cart: Creating a shopping cart so that customers can shop ‘n’ no. of items and checkout finally with the entire cart. Customers can add or delete items in the cart.
  
  •	Payment: Adequate payment mechanism and gateway for all popular credit cards, cheques, and other relevant payment options, as available from time to time.
  
  •	Logout: After ordering or browsing for the products customer has to logout.
  
  •	Report Generation: After ordering for the product the system will send one copy of the bill to the customer’s Email-address and another one for the system data base.
  
Administrator:

  •	Database management: Control the database and keep track of all records of customers.
  
  •	View all details: View the details of customers, orders and control the whole application.
  
  •	Update the items available: Update and remove items from the database and application.
  
FUNTIONAL OBJECTIVES:

  •	High Priority:
  
    	It should be able to store and secure user details.
    	The data should be stored or deleted about the personal details by the user.
    	The order should be shipped to the correct address.
    	The cart details should be always atomic and updated. No discrepancies allowed.
    
  •	Medium Priority:
  
    	Some data should be hidden from the user and shown if the user wants to view.
    	All data should be up to date.
    	Updating the database as the admin adds or updates with new products.
    
  •	Low Priority:
  
    	Use manual/instruction guide on how to use the application.
    	The loading of images for the items.
    
  NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Initial non-functional requirements for the system will be (insurance to the internet):
  
  Performance Requirements:
  
    •	The system shall accommodate high number of items and users without any fault.
    •	Responses to view information shall take no longer than 5 seconds to appear on the screen.
Safety Requirements:

    •	System use shall not cause any harm to human users.
    
Security Requirements:

    •	System will use secured database
    •	Normal users can just read information, but they cannot edit or modify anything except their personal and some other information.
    •	System will have different types of users and every user has access constraints.
    
Error Handling:

    •	Online Fandom Shop shall handle expected and non-expected errors in ways that prevent loss in information and long downtime period.
    
Other non-functional requirements:

  •	Secure access to consumer’s confidential data.
  •	24X7 availability
  •	Better component design to get better performance at peak time.
  •	Flexible service-based architecture will be highly desirable for future extension. Non-Functional Requirements define system properties and constraints.
  •	Various other Non-Functional Requirements are:
    	Security
    	Reliability
    	Maintainability
    	Portability
    	Extensibility
    	Reusability
    	Compatibility
    	Resource Utilization
